            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>
                    I am a leader in software organizations with experience ranging from development, implementation,
                    deployment, to support. My background in each of these areas gives perspective and informs my
                    mindful but ambitious attitude. The interesting part about me isn't the variety in my experience,
                    but the evolution of the motivation behind it. Over time, I shifted my focus from what I was doing
                    to why I was doing it. I was keenly aware and interested in the end-user experience of my individual
                    or my team's work and found that the best were ones where the user could experience a feeling of
                    joy. I would think of ways to make the user think, "Oh, I like that!" when they would use whatever I
                    was working on. It seemed like a very simple idea, but not one that was often talked about in a room
                    full of developers and operations folk. By combining my technical experience with my passion for
                    understanding users and their motivation, I have been able to make a marked improvement in each
                    organization I joined. Just a few of my successes include decreasing the response time and
                    increasing the resolution rate of operations issues at KWI, increasing uptime and stability of
                    services at Deutsche Bank, and automating and innovating development and deployment workflows at
                    IPsoft. I am currently working on several different software projects (some of which are detailed
                    below!) as well as working full time for a software company in New York City (again, check out the
                    details below). Feel free to reach out and follow me on the social media at the very bottom of the
                    page, or use the contact form sitting right there to drop me an email.
